# School_District_Analysis
Analysis for School Districts Python

There were quite a few null values through-out the math and reading scores data that I was curious about. It perhaps would
have been better to try and understand why those values were there instead of just dropping them immediately.



You can also see that charter schools tend to be smaller in student size and also budget size. It would be interesting
to see what percentage graduate from these two types of schools. Unfortunatley we don't have that data, but if we went off of
math scores and reading scores only maybe we can make an assumptions of how many students possibly graduated?
